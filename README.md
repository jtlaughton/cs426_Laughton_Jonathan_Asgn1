Theme Metrics:

My game follows the theme of what home means to you by being modeled after my room, and by being tied into recent events in
my life. The reason why I went with a model of my room and then a generic outdoor scene was because recently I had to
quarantine due to COVID-19 exposure, so I had been seeing a lot of my room lately, and was beginning to miss just going 
outside. The seuquence of events in the game then represent the last day of quarantine, where are turn off/destroy all the
things I used to distract myself, and then go outside finally.
